        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">
          Nimmakuru, near Machilipatnam, India—died January 18, 1996,
          Hyderabad), Indian motion-picture actor and director, politician, and
          government official who founded the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and
          served three terms (1983–84; 1984–89; and 1994–95) as chief minister
          (head of government) of Andhra Pradesh state in southeastern India. As
          an actor he rose to superstardom among the country’s Telugu-speaking
          people and parlayed his fame into a successful political career. The
          man who would became popularly known as NTR was born in a small
          village near the coastal city of Machilipatnam (now in Andhra Pradesh)
          to a poor farming family. He completed a bachelor’s degree from Andhra
          Christian College in nearby Guntur. After qualifying for the civil
          service in what was then the Madras Presidency under British India, he
          took a job as a sub-registrar at Mangalagiri, northeast of Guntur. He
          soon left that post, however, to pursue a career in acting. NTR’s
          first film, Mana Desam, was released in 1949, and he continued to make
          movies until 1982, appearing in some 300 films and directing more than
          a dozen. He quickly demonstrated enormous popular appeal and soon
          attained cult-figure status. He often portrayed a Hindu god,
          particularly Krishna, in his movies, and his adoption of the white or
          saffron robes of his costumes as his everyday dress only reinforced
          his lofty image. In March 1982 he founded the TDP, with the stated
          objective of protecting the interests of India’s Telugu-speaking
          people. The TDP turned out to be highly successful at consolidating
          voters against the then-ruling Indian National Congress (Congress
          Party) in the state. Riding on NTR’s popularity, TDP-affiliated
          candidates (contesting as independents, since the party was still
          unregistered) won a large majority of seats in the 1983 elections to
          the Andhra Pradesh legislative assembly. The party subsequently formed
          a government, with NTR as the first non-Congress chief minister since
          the establishment of the state in 1956.
